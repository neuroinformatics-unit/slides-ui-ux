## What is UX?

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em"}
[Definition according to NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/
){preview-link="true" style="text-align: center"}
:::

> "User experience" encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products. 

## Why talk about UX in RSE?
* an often-neglected, possibly key indicator of success in (open) research software
* being discussed more and more on the RSE grapevine
* as a group, we develop (desktop, web) apps (napari, RSP vision, ...)

## Why should I talking about UX?
* went on a two-day evening course once, so I am qualified (obviously!)
* Almost all major coding projects I've worked on had a UI component (but I've only recently _really_ started to this about this!) 
* a key principle used to guide decisions about BrainGlobe

## The app designer's challenge {.smaller}

> We’re Responsible for Big, Complex Products...
>
> ...That Are Cluttered...
>
> ...Confusing...
>
> ...Involve Complicated, Repetitive Workflows...
>
> ...And Present Complex Data...
>
> ...with Long legacies...
>
> ...And if We Change Things, People Get Angry.

## Key themes in approaching to this challenge (TLDR of NN/g course)

- Understand the user task
- minimise visual search
- use progressive disclosure
- don't surprise users

## Minimise visual search

- Fitt's law
- Group things that belong together
- experience == expectation

Example: BrainGlobe header widget

## An example

## [Progressive disclosure](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/)

> Progressive disclosure defers advanced or rarely used features to a secondary screen...

Example: `brainglobe-registration`

## Understanding the user task

- The app’s conceptual model should match users’ mental model.

Example: version manager widget


## Understanding the user task

(An example from personal experience where the UX went ~wrong because of a decision I took)

## Don't surprise your users

- Communicate changes well, and change things gradually.

Example: Will Graham's blogs on BrainGlobe website.

## How can we improve this menu?

## Stuff I wonder about

* How can we make UI/UX-related code good?
* How can we cater to different types of users?
* How can we do User Research well (at SWC)?
* What makes Resarch-related UI/UX special (if anything)?
* Can we use UX insights to improve the developer/contributor experience?

## Other people working in this area (that I'm aware of)
* Meag Doherty (NIH, UX lead) (e.g. her [Usable Software Ecosystem Research](https://user-project.superbloom.design/) website)
* Diego Alonso Álvarez (Head of RSE at Imperial College London) (e.g. [a blog about GUIs in Research Software](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/guis-research-software-why-are-they-relevant-part-one) resulting from his 2021 SSI fellowship)
* Napari community (e.g. [issue 6345: Explore layer groups design and function ](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/6345))
* US-RSE UX working group (#wg-ux, #ux channels)
